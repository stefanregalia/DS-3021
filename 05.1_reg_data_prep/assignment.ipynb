Review this page: [Non-Linear with Linear](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/python_scripts/linear_regression_non_linear_link.html) What are two ways to incorporate nonlinear relationships between your target/response/dependent/outcome variable $y$ and your features/control/response/independent variables $x$?\n",

Split the sample 80/20 into a training and a test set and run a regression including that kind of \"property type X neighborhood\" dummy, plus `Review Scores Rating`. How does the slope coefficient for `Review Scores Rating`, the $R^2$, and the RMSE change? Do they increase significantly compares to part 5? Are the coefficients in this regression just the sum of the coefficients for `Neighbourhood ` and `Property Type` from 5? What is the most expensive kind of property you can rent?"

For your best model with expanded features, what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE`? How does it compare to your best model from part 4?\n",

Do the predicted values and true values roughly line up along the diagonal, or not? Compute the residuals/errors for the test data and create a kernel density plot. Do the residuals look roughly bell-shaped around zero? Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your model."
